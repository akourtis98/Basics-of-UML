# `UML Theory`
# Structural UML diagrams
* Class diagram:  
Class diagrams are the backbone of almost every object-oriented method, including UML. The describe the static structure of a system.
* Package diagram:  
Packagr diagrams are a subset of class diagrams, but developers sometimes treat them as a seperate technique. Package diagrams organize elements of a system into related groups to minimze dependencies between packages.  
These diagrams have symbols defining a package that look like a folder.

* Object diagram:  
Object diagrams describr the static structure ofa system at a particular time. They can be useed to test class diagrams for accuracy.
* Component diagram:  
A component diagram depicts how components are wired together to form larger components or software systems. They are used to illustrate the structure of arbitrarily complex systems.
* Compossite diagram:   
Composite structure diagrams show the internal part of a class.
# Behavioral UML diagrams
* Acitvity diagram:  
Activity diagrams illustrate the dynamic nature of a system by modeling the flow control from activity to activity. An activity represenets an operation on some class in the system that results in a change in the state of the system. Typically, activity diagrams are used to model workflow ot business pprocesses and internal operation.  
These diagrams have symbols for activities, states, including seperate symbols for an initial state and a final state. The control flow is usually shown with an arrow and the object flow is shown with a dashed arrow.  
`Initial and final state:`

* Sequence diagram:  
Sequence diagram describe interaction among classes in terms of an exchnage of messages over time.
* Use case diagram:  
Use case diagrams are usually referred to as behavior diagrams used to describe a set of actions (use cases) that some system or systems (subject) should or can perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system (actors).
* State diagram:  
State chart diagrams, now known as state machine diagrams and state diagrams describe the dynamic behavior of a system in response to external stimuli. State diagrams are especially useful in modeling reactive objects whose states are triggered by specific events.
* Cmmunication diagram:    
Communication diagrams model the interactions between the objects in sequence. They describe both the static structure and the dynamic behavior of a sytem. In many ways, a communication diagram is a simplified version of a collaboration diagram introduced in UML 2.0
* Intercative overview diagram:    
Interaction overview diagrams are a combination of activity and sequence diagrams. They model a sequence of actions and let you deconstruct more complex interactions into manageble occurences. You should use the same notation on interaction overview diagrams that oy would see on an activity diagram.
* Timing diagram:   
A timing diagram is a type of behavioral or interaction UML diagram that focuses on processess that take place during a specific period of time. They're a special instance of a sequence diagram, except time is shown to increase from left to right instead of top down.
